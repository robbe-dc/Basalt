# GPU holder

This is a special part that can be used to mount the rear of the GPU to the case so it is very firmly held into place. This requires your GPU to have special mounting points used for server mounting. Most Nvidia GPU's have those mouning points and some AMD cards as well.

Those screw holes are usually M3 and you best use countersunk screws to avoind interferance with the top fan.

To know if your GPU has these mounting points, refer to the following images:
