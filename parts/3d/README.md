# 3D printed parts

This folder contains each required 3D printed part for the case. Each folder has its own readme file with print instructions for the specific file.

## Print settings and material

Preferably, print this in PETG with at least 3 perimeters. Infill won't matter a lot because there is so little of it.

I have also made versions in PLA but found them to be a bit too brittle and the adhesion between layers was a bit too weak to withstand the force of the screws.
