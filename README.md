# Basalt is an open source vertical computer case

Basalt was created as an open source, DIY alternative to popular SFF cases on the market. The aim is to create a small computer case with emphasis on tiny desk footprint, while still supporting today's hardware.

Basalt is made out of easy to source/create materials so it is easy to make it yourself. The main things you need are (access to) a 3D printer and a laser cutter. If you do not own these machines and do not have access to them, I advice you to try a local fablab or use online services like Shapeways, i.materialise and others.

## Hardware support

Hardware support is as following:

* ITX motherboard
* 48mm CPU cooler
* SFX(L) PSU support
* Top mounted 120mm fan
* 2x 2.5" drives up to 9mm thick
* GPU:
  * 60mm thick (3 slots) as long as the PCI bracket is 1 or 2 slot
  * 140mm high plus an extra 16mm for power connectors
  * 325mm length without top fan, 321mm with 15mm top fan, 311mm with 25mm top fan

## Getting started

* Source the materials from the [shopping list](docs/SHOPPINGLIST.md)
* Read about the [preparations](docs/PREPARATIONS.md)
* Print the required parts
* Lasercut the panels
* Build the case using the [assembly guide](docs/ASSEMBLY.md)
