# Building Basalt

This guide is split up in 2 parts: [assembling the case](#assembly) and [inserting the hardware](#inserting-the-hardware).

## Assembly

Start by attaching the extrusions to the bottom part. Be careful at this point because the extrusions won't be held into place very well yet so they may fall over and damage the attached parts in the process.

We'll go on with the front. You'll have to slide the parts in the extrusions from the top of the case from now on.

If you have printed the extrusion inserts, now is the time to insert the two number 1s in the front. If you haven't please consider again because this is hard without and you'll have to use the hardware later on to get the measurements.

With the extrusion inserts into place, you can now attach the motherboard bottom front.

Next, insert both extrusion inserts labeled number 2. You'll now know where to attach the motherboard top front part.

Before attaching the top, we'll first have to attach the back parts.

The PSU bottom part is first. Don't tighten this too hard yet, we'll have to loosen it again to insert the GPU later on when assembling the hardware.

Insert the extrusion insert number 3 on the motherboard side and then the PSU bottom on top.

Insert number 4 goes on the GPU side and the motherboard bottom back should rest on the PSU top part and the extrusion insert.

The final piece, the top, should be aligned nicely with the top of the extrusions and thus need no extrusion inserts.

Only thing left now is the accessories: the front I/O and the riser. We won't be able to insert the riser before the GPU is mounted, so we'll only mount the front I/O for now.

The front I/O simply screws into the bottom part on the front. Make sure to insert it upside down or it won't line up with the front panel.

## Inserting the hardware

To insert the hardware, we'll temporarily take out the top printed part. We'll insert it again throughout the hardware process.

**GPU**

We'll start out with the largest part, the GPU. The easiest is to insert the GPU itself is at an edge from the side of the case. If you have a very large card, this may not be possible. I would then advice to insert it from the top but be carefull not to damage parts with the PCI bracket.

To insert the GPU, we first have to slide up the PSU bottom part a bit because the PCI tab will have to come between the bottom part and the PSU bottom part. You may to temporarily take out the extrusion insert that keeps it into place for this.

Push the PSU bottom all the way down and make sure the PCI bracket is held well into place. Screw the PSU bottom part into the extrusions and the bottom and insert the extrusion inserts again.

Now we can also attach the riser to the GPU and screw it into the PSU bottom part and the motherboard bottom back.

Screw in the PCI tab on the bottom. If the front I/O is too inconvinient, you can also temporarily take it out.

**Motherboard**

The motherboard goes in next. Install the memory and CPU cooler before you put it into the case. If your CPU cooler blocks access to certain ports, insert those cables already.

The board is inserted from the top and at this point there should be only 3 mounting points available. After you've screwed the board to those 3 points, you can insert the top part again and screw the board to the fourth point.

Now comes a tricky part: the riser cable. Lay it out horizontally so you can see where the bend needs to come. Start by gently bending the riser and lining it up with the PCI connector on the motherboard. When you're certain the it's lined up well, pinch the bend together so it gets as tight as possible without damaging the riser.

**PSU**

Next is the PSU. I would advice to already plug in the cables you require before inserting it into the case. Make sure the fan is facing outwards so it doesn't suffocate.

Take care when mounting the PSU to the printed parts as this is the only part that uses 6-32 screws.

When the PSU is inserted, you can route the cables and insert the into the components. There is some room in front of the PSU for excess cabling when using a standard SFX PSU.

**Final accesories**

We're almost ready now, only some minor things left. The video output extensions can be mounted to the case and inserterd in the GPU. It requires countersunk M4 screws. Don't overtighten countersunk screws as they will break the plastic parts!!

Now is the time to reinsert the top printed part and mount fourth screw of the motherboard in the mount. They should line up if everything went well.

<img src="./images/hardware11.png" width="600">


We're gonna start attaching panels now. The top panel is first, but some things need to be mounted to it first. Use you 16mm vandal switch in the front and mount it with the bolt that comes with it.

The (optional) top fan is next. It mount to the top panel using self tapping screws in the 4 screw holes. You may want to countersink the holes if you got a drill with a countersinking bit to make it look better.

Wen everything is mounted, you can carefuly drop the panel down into the case and screw it to the extrusions using M6 screws (or smaller if the tapping on your extrusion isn't M6).

The bottom is next, which is screws into the extrusion using your choice of case feet.

The remaining panels are attached using the magnets, easy enough.

You are now done, hooray!
