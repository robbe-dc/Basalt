## About the video extension cables

The video extension cables come from ADT-Link. You should buy cables that have an angled male connector form your GPU on one side and a threaded female connector on the other side. ADT-Link connectors are easy to find on Aliexpress.

When using 1 cable, the cable should be 5cm long and it doesn't really mather what angle you pick. I went with a 5cm P3 to P4T displayport cable.

When using 2 cables, it gets a bit more complicated. The first cable should be 5cm long and the angle isn't too important again. The second cable should use the opposite angle and should be 10cm long. This allows for much easier cable routing because they don't have to cross eachother.
