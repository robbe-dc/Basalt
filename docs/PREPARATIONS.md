# Preparing the parts

Looks like you've succeeded collecting all required parts, which is a challange to start with. Well done! Now let's get building.

## Inserting threaded inserts

Threaded inserts are melted into certain parts with a soldering iron so we can screw into them without wearing out the plastic.

GENERAL GUIDE ABOUT THREADED INSERTS

There are several pieces that require threaded inserts:

### Bottom

The bottom requires he following inserts:

* 2x 4mm inserts for the front IO
* 2x 4mm inserts for the GPU PCI tab
* 2x 3mm inserts for the GPU PCI clamp (above the video outputs)

### Motherboard parts x4

The three individual motherboard parts all need inserts to mount the motherboard. Make sure you check what the front and the back are so you insert the the right direction. The top of the insert should be the non-chamfered edge because that's where the motherboard comes.

### Top

Finally, the top also needs one insert for the last motherboard mount. There is no way of checking for non-chamfered sides here, but you can make out the sides because this part is not symmetrical.

## Attaching the T-nuts

The T-slot nuts will slide into the extrusion and the printed parts are then screwn into the nuts. This is hard to do when the nuts slide all over the place, so I prefer to attach the nuts to the parts before sliding them into the extrusion.

You can do so by screwing the nuts to the part with the M3x10mm screws, but don't tighten it yet as you won't be able to slide them in the extrusion anymore. Do this for all parts that require T-slot nuts, which are the following:

* Bottom: 8 nuts
* PSU bottom: 2 nuts
* PSU top: 1 nut
* Motherboard bottom back: 4 nuts
* Motherboard bottom front: 4 nuts
* Motherboard top front: 2 nuts
* Top: 8 nuts

## Add front IO pcb to bottom part.

This should be self explanatory, just remember to mount the PCB upside down.
